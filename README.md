Generic Connection Pool

This is a small jar implementation for JDBC connection pooling implemented using java

It has various flavours of connection pools like BlockingConnectionPool and NonBlockingConnectionPool

Desired flavour/instance of connection pool can be obtained from PoolFactory

For extensibility and maintenance sake, proper abstraction has been achieved
